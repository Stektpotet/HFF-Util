#Human: Fall Flat - Utility Toolset

This Repository is a collection of tools built ontop of the Human API provided by the creators of the game _Human: Fall Flat_ (From this point on refered to as "HFF") and utility/example assets for building your own levels within the modder-branch of HFF (Currently available as an opt-in beta for members of the open HFFWorkshop Community group on Steam)

---

## Installation

####If using Git

`git submodule add https://github.com/stektpotet/HFF-Util `

This will add these files into your local workdir as a submodule, rather than beeing part of your own repo
(https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

### Otherwise

Click the `Clone or Download` button and extract the asset files into your mod work directory

##Features

It's currently very limited, but due time, I'm sure It'll grow into something bigger.

For now, here's a feature list:

* Simple & Elegant Creation of new, valid (as per defined by HumanExporter) levels:
  * Ctrl+L - Creates a simple scene with the basic requirements of levels.
  * Ctrl+Alt+L - Creates a more complex scene where you can define how many checkpoints you expect will be in the map, and the generator will make checkpoints and zones for you.
* Fixed rotation issues in the HumanWorkshop prefabs.
